  <h1>Final Project - Systems Analysis and Development</h1>

  <h2>ðŸ“– About</h2>
  <p>
    This project was the capstone of my Systems Analysis and Development course. It was a challenging experience that required me to work with various programming languages and technologies.  
    <br><br>
    The challenge was to develop a payroll system for a fictitious medium-sized company. The system needed to include:
    <ul>
      <li>A login system integrated with a database.</li>
      <li>The automation of payroll processing.</li>
      <li>Three levels of user access: admin, developer, and employee.</li>
    </ul>
    The project was developed using the <strong>Scrum methodology</strong>, ensuring efficient teamwork and progress through well-structured sprints.  
    <br><br>
    This experience significantly helped me grow as a developer and broaden my understanding of real-world systems development.
